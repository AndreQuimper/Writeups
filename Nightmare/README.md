There is a really nice Github Pages site by Guyinatuxedo which has lots of challenges and explanations on binary exploitation. Here I will upload writeups to the challenges referenced in the GitBook.  
The binaries can be downloaded from the gitbook and there also writeups there (probably better than mine, but it is more of a personal exercise and also might provide a second perspective on the challenges).
