The point of the challenge is to "find the flag".  
Looking at the name of the challenge is a big hint to realize that we have to run the `strings` command.  
However we are faced with the following:

Thousands, if not more, of randomly generated strings to make our search harder.  
However since I knew that the flag (by convention) would contain a "{" character, I could use a grep command.
